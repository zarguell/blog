Hi!  My name is Zach Arguelles. I'm a security nut with a passion for self-hosting. This blog is generated statically via Jekyll, published via Netlify, and I plan to use it to write about security, automation, or whatever I want to write for whoever wants to listen.

All credit for the theme goes to the great YouTuber TechnoTim; his great [docs site](https://docs.technotim.live/) gave me the inspriation to start document my ramblings in the same format.
